# 6.Using Bind Mounts

In the previous chapter, we talked about and used a **named volume** to persist the data in our database. Named volumes are great if we simply want to store data, as we don't have to worry about *where* the data is stored.

With **bind mounts**, we control the exact mountpoint on the host. We can use this to persist data, but is often used to provide additional data into containers. When working on an application, we can use a bind mount to mount our source code into the container to let it see code changes, respond, and let us see the changes right away.

For Node-based applications, [nodemon](https://npmjs.com/package/nodemon) is a great tool to watch for file changes and then restart the application. There are equivalent tools in most other languages and frameworks.

## Quick Volume Type Comparisons[Â¶](http://localhost/tutorial/using-bind-mounts/#quick-volume-type-comparisons)

Bind mounts and named volumes are the two main types of volumes that come with the Docker engine. However, additional volume drivers are available to support other uses cases ([SFTP](https://github.com/vieux/docker-volume-sshfs), [Ceph](https://ceph.com/geen-categorie/getting-started-with-the-docker-rbd-volume-plugin/), [NetApp](https://netappdvp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [S3](https://github.com/elementar/docker-s3-volume), and more).

| Host Location                                | Docker chooses            | You control                   |
| Mount Example (using `-v`)                   | my-volume:/usr/local/data | /path/to/data:/usr/local/data |
| Populates new volume with container contents | Yes                       | No                            |
| Supports Volume Drivers                      | Yes                       | No                            |
